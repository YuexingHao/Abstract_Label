<div><h2>Article #0</h2><h1>Factors Associated with Functional Capacity Test Results in Patients With Non-Specific Chronic Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review</h1><a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10926-011-9306-4>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10926-011-9306-4</a><div><p><em>Introduction</em>:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Functional capacity tests</span>&nbsp;are standardized instruments to evaluate <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">patients&rsquo;&nbsp;capacities to execute work-related activities</span>.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Functional capacity test&nbsp;results</span> are associated with biopsychosocial factors, making it unclear what is being <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">measured in capacity testing</span>. An overview of these factors was missing. The objective of this review was to investigate the level of evidence for factors that are associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">functional capacity test results</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #99ccff;">patients with non-specific chronic low back pain</span>.&nbsp;<em>Methods:</em>&nbsp;A systematic literature review was performed identifying relevant studies from an electronic journal databases search. Candidate studies employed a cross-sectional or RCT design and were published between 1980 and October 2010. The quality of these studies was determined and level of evidence was reported for factors that were associated with <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">capacity results</span> in at least 3 studies.&nbsp;<em>Results:</em>&nbsp;Twenty-two studies were included. The level of evidence was reported for&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">lifting low, lifting high, carrying, and static lifting capacity</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Lifting low test results</span> were associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">self-reported disability and specific self-efficacy</span>&nbsp;but not with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #00ff00;">pain duration</span>. There was conflicting evidence for associations of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">lifting low</span> with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">pain intensity,&nbsp;fear of movement/(re)injury,&nbsp;depression,&nbsp;gender&nbsp;and&nbsp;age</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Lifting high</span> was associated with&nbsp;gender&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">specific self-efficacy</span>, but not with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">pain intensity or&nbsp;age</span>. There is conflicting evidence for the association of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">lifting high</span> with the factors&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">self-reported disability,&nbsp;pain duration&nbsp;and&nbsp;depression</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Carrying</span> was associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">self-reported disability</span>&nbsp;and not with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #00ff00;">pain intensity</span>&nbsp;and there is conflicting evidence for associations with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">specific self-efficacy,&nbsp;gender&nbsp;and&nbsp;age</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Static lifting</span> was associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #339966;">fear of movement/(re)injury</span>.&nbsp;<em>Conclusions:</em>&nbsp;Much heterogeneity was observed in investigated <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">capacity tests</span> and candidate associated factors. There was some evidence for biological and psychological factors that are or are not associated with <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">capacity results</span> but there is also much conflicting evidence. High level evidence for social factors was absent.</p></div></div>

Four electronic databases were systematically searched the 10th of March 2018, resulting in 12 included studies. Studies showed a risk of bias of 37.5 to 75% using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for case-control studies. Limited evidence reported higher amplitudes of <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">balance-related potentials</span> and early components of <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP)</span> to noxious stimuli, and altered feedback-related negativity and P300 potentials during <span style="background-color: #339966;">decision-making</span> in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">chronic LBP (CLBP)</span>. These findings suggest postural strategies requiring a higher cortical attention-demand, increased <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">sensory-discriminative processing</span> of noxious input, and altered <span style="background-color: #339966;">decision-making</span> in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">CLBP</span>. However, further research is warranted as these inferences were based on single studies. Moderate evidence for unaltered amplitude of late-phase SEPs to noxious stimuli and auditory evoked potentials in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">LBP</span> implies that the affective-emotional processing of stimuli might be unaffected in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">LBP</span>. Furthermore, moderate evidence indicated disturbed habituation of somatosensory stimuli in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">LBP</span>. Most studies examined <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">nonspecific or mixed CLBP populations</span>, hence <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">EEG-quantified brain activity</span> in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">(sub)acute or recurrent LBP</span> still needs to be explored.</p></div><div id="abss0003"><h3 id="cesectitle0004" class="u-h4 u-margin-m-top u-margin-xs-bottom">Perspective</h3><p id="spara017">This review presents an overview of the current understanding of the <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">functional LBP brain</span> <span style="background-color: #99cc00;"><span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">measured with EEG</span></span>.

For some painful conditions, alterations are well-established, but in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">populations with low back pain (LBP)</span>, there remains considerable debate whether these mechanisms are altered. The present systematic review aimed to address this issue by identifying studies assessing <span style="background-color: #00ff00;">conditioned pain modulation (CPM)</span> and/or <span style="background-color: #00ff00;">temporal summation of pain (TSP)</span> in <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">patients with LBP</span>, <span style="background-color: #ff6600;">comparing with either a healthy control group or using a method with reference data available</span>. Qualitative synthesis and quantitative meta-analysis of group differences were performed. For <span style="background-color: #00ff00;">CPM</span> and <span style="background-color: #00ff00;">TSP</span>, 20 and 29 original articles were eligible, with data for meta-analysis obtainable from 18 (<span style="background-color: #33cccc;">1500 patients and 505 controls</span>) and 27 (<span style="background-color: #33cccc;">1507 patients and 1127 controls</span>) studies, respectively. Most studies were of poor-to-fair quality with significant heterogeneity in study size, population, assessment methodology, and outcome.

This is due to the wide array of pathologic conditions causing <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">back pain</span>, the multitude of patient variables (<em>i.e.</em>, litigation, psychologic issues, social issues) that are thought to influence the perception of <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">back pain</span>, and the wide variation in treatment response. <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">Sociodemographic factors</span> are thought to play a role in pain perception and treatment response, though this has been poorly assessed in the literature.</p><h3>Methods.&nbsp;</h3><p><span class="ej-keyword" data-value="Systematic review">Systematic review</span>&nbsp;of the literature, focused on randomized controlled trials to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effect of <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">sociodemographic factors</span> on the <span style="background-color: #808000;">outcomes of fusion&nbsp;<em>versus</em>&nbsp;nonoperative care</span> of the treatment of <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">chronic low back pain</span>.</p><h3>Results.&nbsp;</h3><p>The only <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">sociologic factors</span> evaluated in randomized controlled trials adequate to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect are <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">pending litigation</span>, <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">worker\'s compensation</span>, <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">sick leave</span>, and <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">heavy labor job type</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">Litigation patients</span>, although thought to <span style="background-color: #808000;">do poorly with treatment</span> of <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">chronic low back pain</span> in general, <span style="background-color: #808000;">responded more favorably to fusion than nonoperative care</span>.

Pending litigation may negatively <span style="background-color: #808000;">impact outcomes</span> of <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">patients with chronic low back pain</span>; however, those who underwent <span style="background-color: #808000;">fusion had better outcomes</span> than those with <span style="background-color: #808000;">nonoperative management</span> in two European studies. There is no evidence to suggest that <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">sociodemographic factors</span> alone should <span style="background-color: #808000;">preclude surgery</span>. Well-constructed prospective randomized studies with predefined subgroup analyses are required to further understand the impact of <span style="background-color: #ffff99;">sociodemographic factors</span> in the treatment of <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">chronic low back pain</span>.</p><h3>Clinical Recommendations.&nbsp;</h3><p><span style="background-color: #ffff99;">Sociodemographic factors</span> should be considered when making treatment decisions for <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">patients with chronic low back pain</span>, but alone <span style="background-color: #808000;">do not preclude fusion</span> for <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">chronic low back pain</span>.

However, even for <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">disc protrusion</span>, estimates of the corresponding <span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">prevalence rate ratios</span> were mostly less than 2.</p><h3>Conclusion.&nbsp;</h3><p><span style="background-color: #008080;">MRI findings</span> of <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">disc protrusion</span>, <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">nerve root displacement or compression</span>, <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">disc degeneration</span>, and <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">high intensity zone</span> are all <span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">associated with</span> <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">LBP</span>, but individually, none of these <span style="background-color: #008080;">abnormalities</span> provides a strong indication that <span style="background-color: #99ccff;">LBP</span> is attributable to underlying pathology.
