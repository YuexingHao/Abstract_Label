        <em>Introduction</em>:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Functional capacity tests</span>&nbsp;are standardized instruments to evaluate <span style="background-color: #99cc00;">patients&rsquo;&nbsp;capacities to execute work-related activities</span>.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">Functional capacity test&nbsp;results</span> are associated with biopsychosocial factors, making it unclear what is being <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">measured in capacity testing</span>. An overview of these factors was missing. The objective of this review was to investigate the level of evidence for factors that are associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">functional capacity test results</span>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #99ccff;">patients with non-specific chronic low back pain</span>.&nbsp;<em>Methods:</em>&nbsp;A systematic literature review was performed identifying relevant studies from an electronic journal databases search. Candidate studies employed a cross-sectional or RCT design and were published between 1980 and October 2010. The quality of these studies was determined and level of evidence was reported for factors that were associated with <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">capacity results</span> in at least 3 studies.&nbsp;<em>Results:</em>&nbsp;Twenty-two studies were included. The level of evidence was reported for&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">lifting low, lifting high, carrying, and static lifting capacity</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Lifting low test results</span> were associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">self-reported disability and specific self-efficacy</span>&nbsp;but not with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #00ff00;">pain duration</span>. There was conflicting evidence for associations of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">lifting low</span> with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">pain intensity,&nbsp;fear of movement/(re)injury,&nbsp;depression,&nbsp;gender&nbsp;and&nbsp;age</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Lifting high</span> was associated with&nbsp;gender&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">specific self-efficacy</span>, but not with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">pain intensity or&nbsp;age</span>. There is conflicting evidence for the association of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">lifting high</span> with the factors&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">self-reported disability,&nbsp;pain duration&nbsp;and&nbsp;depression</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Carrying</span> was associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">self-reported disability</span>&nbsp;and not with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #00ff00;">pain intensity</span>&nbsp;and there is conflicting evidence for associations with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ccffcc;">specific self-efficacy,&nbsp;gender&nbsp;and&nbsp;age</span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">Static lifting</span> was associated with&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #339966;">fear of movement/(re)injury</span>.&nbsp;<em>Conclusions:</em>&nbsp;Much heterogeneity was observed in investigated <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">capacity tests</span> and candidate associated factors. There was some evidence for biological and psychological factors that are or are not associated with <span style="background-color: #ffcc99;">capacity results</span> but there is also much conflicting evidence. High level evidence for social factors was absent.
